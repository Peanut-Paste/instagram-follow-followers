# instagram-follow-followers
This is part of the course that I am currently taking. This project will follow a specific account's follower.
setup - 
instagram_email = your instagram account email
instagram_pw = your instagram account password
scroll_container_to_bottom function in instafollower.py set your max scroll on how many times you want to scroll before initializing the following bot.
follow function in instafollower.py set the time.sleep to how long you want to wait before following a new account.

Some times there's an extra prompt to ask if you want to turn on the notification, which would trigger a error message. Just re-run the program.

Please note that I am not responsible for anything related in regards to your account. Use this program at your own risk.
